# Calculate-Word-Distance
C++ program that calculates the "distance" between two words of a given length. Distance is calculated using a Thue system-like grammar rule. For example the distance between "CAT" and "BAT" is 1, because one letter is changed (C to B). The distance between "CAT" and "BAR" is 2 (CAT -> CAR -> BAR).
